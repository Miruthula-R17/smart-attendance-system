## Libraries Used:
○ Numpy - could be a library for Python, adding support for multi-dimensional arrays and
matrices, in conjunction with an enormous assortment of high-level mathematical functions to
operate on these arrays. \
○ Pandas - is a fast, powerful, flexible, and easy to use open-source data analysis and
manipulation tool, built on top of the Python programming language. \
○ Haar Cascade - is a machine learning object detection algorithm used to identify objects in
an image or video and based on the concept of​ features proposed by Paul Viola and Michael
Jones in their paper "Rapid Object Detection using a Boosted Cascade of Simple Features" in
2001. \
○ Datetime - It’s a combination of date and time along with the attributes year, month, day,
hour, minute, second, microsecond, and info. \
○ Face_Recognition - Recognize and manipulate faces from Python or the command line
with the world’s simplest face recognition library. \
○ OpenCV - a library of programming functions primarily geared toward real-time
computer vision.
